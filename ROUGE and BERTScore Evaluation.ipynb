Please DM your confirm # and I can see if there is another seat to move to. *TJW \\nuser: I'll pull up your reply if I ever run into a similar issue. There were empty seats on the flight, and I moved. It seems that your gate agent simply didn't feel like making the effort to find me another seat. DL 1105 from Atlanta today. Thanks for replying.  And for the record - she told me flat out that the ticket I purchased allowed for middle seats only.\\nagent: I am very sorry that you were told the wrong information. I'm glad you were able to move but I apologize that the agent did not assist you with this. I will forward this to Atlanta Leadership so they are aware of the incident. We are always here on Twitter to help, too. *TJW\\nuser: Thank you!\\nagent: You are welcome. Have a wonderful week. *TJW\\nuser: You too. Glad to hear the policy is not what I was told.\\nagent: Moving forward, I hope it will be a better experience for you for your seating arrangements the next time, Hadas.
