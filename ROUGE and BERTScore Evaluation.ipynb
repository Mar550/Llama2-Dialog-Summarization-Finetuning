       "\"<s>[INST] <<SYS>> The following text is a conversation between a human and an AI agent. Write a summary of the conversation. <</SYS>> user: it would have been really nice when I booked my ticket to get a heads up that my purchase ONLY allowed a middle seat. That's what they're telling me here at the gate in Atlanta, anyway... 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ I'm a traveler who reads the fine print, so this is disappointing\\nagent: Hi Hadas, none of our tickets restrict you to middle seats only. If available, you should be able to move to a window or aisle. I'm sorry for the incorrect information. Please DM your confirm # and I can see if there is another seat to move to. *TJW \\nuser: I'll pull up your reply if I ever run into a similar issue. There were empty seats on the flight, and I moved. It seems that your gate agent simply didn't feel like making the effort to find me another seat. DL 1105 from Atlanta today. Thanks for replying.  And for the record - she told me flat out that the ticket I purchased allowed for middle seats only.\\nagent: I am very sorry that you were told the wrong information. I'm glad you were able to move but I apologize that the agent did not assist you with this. I will forward this to Atlanta Leadership so they are aware of the incident. We are always here on Twitter to help, too. *TJW\\nuser: Thank you!\\nagent: You are welcome. Have a wonderful week. *TJW\\nuser: You too. Glad to hear the policy is not what I was told.\\nagent: Moving forward, I hope it will be a better experience for you for your seating arrangements the next time, Hadas. We value your patronage with us. Best to you and your travels that are coming! *ADB\\n [/INST] Customer is complaining that he was told that the ticket he purchased allowed for middle seats only. Agent updated that none of their tickets restrict them to middle seats only and if available they should be able to move to a window or aisle.\""
